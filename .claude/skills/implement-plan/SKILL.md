description: Execute a phased implementation plan from `ai-plans/` in vinta_schedule_api by orchestrating one subagent per phase (using whatever model the plan suggests and the runtime supports), pushing one stacked branch per phase to GitHub, and tracking progress. Use when the user says "implement the plan", "execute plan X", "start implementation", "run phase N of plan Y", "implement {feature} plan", or asks to drive a `*_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` file phase-by-phase. NOT for one-off changes, single-file edits, or work that doesn't have an existing plan. Agents push branches and open PRs via `gh` after review passes.

# Implement Plan

Drive a phased plan in [`ai-plans/`](ai-plans/) to completion: spawn one subagent per phase (whichever model plan recommends + runtime can run), run lint / typecheck / unit / e2e (where applicable), push one stacked GitHub branch per phase, keep a progress tracking file as context handoff between phases. Harness-agnostic — claude-code, OpenAI Codex, Google's runtime, or any framework with a "spawn subagent with model + prompt" primitive.

Execution counterpart to [plan-feature](../plan-feature/SKILL.md). Plan = contract; this skill = build pipeline.

## Working assumptions

- Repo: vinta-schedule-frontend-web (Next.js 16 App Router + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4, TanStack Query, Radix UI, hey-api OpenAPI client, Storybook). Conventions: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
- Plan files: [`ai-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-FEATURE_NAME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](ai-plans/).
- Lint: `npm run lint`. Format check: `npm run format`. Format fix: `npm run format:fix`.
- Type / build gate: `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) plus `npm run build` (`next build`).
- Unit tests: `npm run test` (everything, `vitest run`); scoped via `npm run test -- <path>`; watch via `npm run test:watch`.

- OpenAPI client regen (when API schema changes): `npm run openapi-ts` (main) + `npm run openapi-ts-auth` (auth client).
- Code host: **GitHub**. PR creation policy: **agents create PRs** — every phase opens a PR via the bundled prs-context file + [open-pr.sh](../open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh).
- Co-author trailer policy: **forbidden**. Commits must not include `Co-Authored-By:` AI trailers.

## Step 0 — Locate + parse plan

Parse once, reuse for every phase:

1. **Identify plan file.** Ask user which plan (path or feature name). Feature name: `ls ai-plans/` + grep; confirm before proceeding.
2. **Extract structured fields**, in order:
   - **Feature name** + **plan id** — derived from filename's `FEATURE_NAME` portion only: strip `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix + `_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` suffix. Kebab variant for branch names.
   - **Goals + Non-goals** section — verbatim, used in every phase prompt.
   - **Guiding Decisions** section — verbatim. Pay attention to: feature flag (key, scope, default, flip-on criterion), storage shape, tenant scoping, API contract decisions.
   - **Data Model Changes** section — keep full body; later phases reference earlier subsections.
   - **Phased Rollout** section — parse into phase records: `{ id, title, goal, body, spec_use_case, suggested_model_tier, reusable_skills, has_e2e, acceptance, is_cross_repo, is_flag_removal }`.
   - **Risk & Rollout Notes**, **Open Questions**, **Touch List** sections — keep available; include in phase prompts only when relevant.
3. **Classify each phase**: `is_cross_repo`, `is_flag_removal` — orchestrator does NOT auto-execute these.
4. **Ask the user two opt-in questions** via `AskUserQuestion`. Both default to off; record both answers in tracking under `run_options`:

   a. **Pause between phases?** _"Do you want me to pause and wait for confirmation after each phase, before starting the next one? Lets you review the diff / branch / PR / tracking summary before moving on."_ Options: `Auto-flow (default) — keep going phase to phase`, `Pause between phases — wait for go after each one`.

   b. **Draft inline review comments per phase?** _"On top of the standard PR description, do you want me to scan each phase's diff and add 3–10 inline comments calling out non-obvious decisions (subtle invariants, feature-flag short-circuits, cross-phase coupling, upstream-contract naming)? Off by default — say yes when reviewers will appreciate annotated diffs."_ Options: `Yes — include inline comments`, `No — PR description only`.

   PR opening itself is **not** asked here — it's governed by the project's PR creation policy captured at bootstrap (see `PR creation policy: **agents create PRs** — every phase opens a PR via the bundled prs-context file + [open-pr.sh](../open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh).` above). When that policy = "agents create PRs", the [Open PR via context file](#1f-open-pr-via-context-file) step always opens the PR via [open-pr.sh](../foundation-skills/open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh) regardless of the comment opt-in.

5. **Confirm with user before starting.** Show plan path, phase list (id + title + tier + cross-repo/flag-removal flags + e2e flag), phases this skill will execute vs defer, branch naming pattern (default: `plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase-id}`), captured `run_options.pause_between_phases` + `run_options.generate_inline_comments`, and that each phase will push its stacked branch and open a PR on GitHub.

   Wait for "go". After that, the per-phase pause behavior follows `run_options.pause_between_phases`. Inline-comment drafting follows `run_options.generate_inline_comments`.

## Step 1 — Per-phase loop

For each phase that's `not is_cross_repo and not is_flag_removal`, in plan order:

### 1a. Prepare agent prompt (token-efficient)

Compose with **only what the agent needs**:

```
You are implementing {phase.id}: {phase.title} of plan {plan.id}.

## Repo
vinta-schedule-frontend-web (Next.js 16 App Router + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4, TanStack Query, Radix UI, hey-api OpenAPI client, Storybook).

## Read first
1. AGENTS.md — repo conventions.
1. DESIGN.md — repo design conventions.
2. ai-plans/{plan-filename}, the **Goals + Non-goals**, **Guiding Decisions**, **Data Model Changes** sections and YOUR phase body inside **Phased Rollout**.

## Plan-level decisions (from Goals + Non-goals + Guiding Decisions)
{Goals + Non-goals verbatim}
{Guiding Decisions table verbatim}
{If feature flag declared:}
  Feature flag: `{flag-key}` — scope `{per-tenant|per-request}`, default `{false|true}`.
  Wire reads + writes per the plan's **Guiding Decisions** entry. Off-flag path = byte-for-byte pre-feature behavior.

## What was already implemented in prior phases
{Tracking file "Completed Phases" section. First executed phase: "Nothing yet — this is the first phase."}

## Your tasks (Phase {id} only)
{phase.body verbatim, including Goal / Spec use-case / Feature flag / Changes / Tests / Acceptance lines}

## Reusable skills you SHOULD invoke
{phase.reusable_skills — for each, instruct the agent to first read ai-tools/skills/{name}/SKILL.md, then follow that pattern.}

Project skills available: plan-feature, open-pr-from-context, implement-plan, amend-plan

## Working instructions
1. Read existing code paths your changes touch — do not write before reading.
2. Implement using Read/Edit/Write. Match existing patterns.
3. **Inner loop — fast iteration.** Scoped to files you touched:
   a. `npm run lint` until clean.
   b. `npm run test -- <new-test-path>` for new tests individually.
   c. Scoped suite: `npm run test -- <dir-or-pattern>`.
4. Iterate 2–3 until **new tests pass individually** and the scoped suite is green. Do **not** advance to step 5 with red scoped tests.
5. **Outer gate — full local verification, only after step 4 is green.** All MUST pass before staging:
   a. **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck`.
   b. **Build:** `npm run build`.
   c. **Full test suite:** `npm run test`.
   d. **Format:** `npm run format` (run `npm run format:fix` to auto-fix).
6. Outer gate fails → return step 2 (fix regression), re-run inner loop, then 5a/5b/5c/5d. **Never** commit, push, or proceed while any gate is red.
7. Stage right files (NEVER `git add -A` — the repo root holds untracked `.env*`, generated `schema.yml` / `schema-auth.yml`, `src/*-client/` regenerated output that `-A` will sweep in). Stage explicitly: `git add src/... ai-plans/... — explicit per-path`.
8. Commit with the repo's style — look at `git log -10 --oneline` first. Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): subject` — e.g. `feat(calendar): add bundle availability filter`, `fix(auth): correct redirect on pending signup step`.
9. Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any other AI) trailer to commits — the project forbids them.
10. Stop after the commit. Orchestrator owns the branch, the push, and the PR.

## Required output (single final report)
- Status: SUCCESS or FAILURE (and why).
- Files created/modified (paths only).
- 5–15 line summary of what you implemented and key decisions.

- Deviations from the plan body and reasoning.
- Anything you couldn't do (with explanation).
```

**Don't** dump the full plan into every prompt. Tracking summaries replace prior phases as context. Always include the **Goals + Non-goals** and **Guiding Decisions** sections plus the relevant **Data Model Changes** subsection — load-bearing decisions; phases reach back frequently.

### 1b. Pick model from plan's per-phase suggestion

**Plan owns model selection — this skill does not re-derive tiers, doesn't assume vendor.** Each phase carries `**Suggested AI model**:` listing one model per vendor.

Pick:

1. Read line, parse out **all** vendor suggestions.
2. **Filter to what's actually available in the runtime.** Different harnesses expose different sets.
3. From surviving suggestions, **pick the cheapest / fastest** the runner can use.
4. Translate the chosen model to whatever form the runner's spawning tool expects.
5. Phase suggestion straddles tiers → pick the higher-tier suggestion.
6. Line missing / malformed → **ask the user**. Don't silently re-derive tier.

**Retry escalation (no user prompt):** picked model fails on a clear capability gap → step **one tier up** + retry once. After Tier 4 fails, STOP. Update tracking with `❌`, post the agent's report to the user, ask how to proceed.

Record the **model actually used** + the **plan's suggested tier** in tracking.

### 1c. Spawn subagent

Use whatever agent-spawning primitive the runtime exposes. Pass:

- Descriptive label (e.g. `"{plan.id} {phase.id}: {phase.title}"`).
- Model from the [Pick model from plan's per-phase suggestion](#1b-pick-model-from-plans-per-phase-suggestion) step, translated.
- Phase prompt from the [Prepare agent prompt](#1a-prepare-agent-prompt-token-efficient) step.
- The right **agent type**.

**Agent type per phase.** Project agents in [`ai-tools/agents/`](ai-tools/agents/) (exposed to claude-code via `.claude/agents` symlink):

| Phase shape                                                                                                                                                                         | Agent type    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Default — any phase whose primary risk is correct execution of the Changes / Tests / Acceptance                                                                                     | `implementer` |
| Schema/contract-heavy — phase regenerates the hey-api OpenAPI client (`npm run openapi-ts` / `npm run openapi-ts-auth`) or reshapes shared TanStack Query / data-fetching contracts | `implementer` |
| Review-only (rare; usually a Layer 3 dispatch from inside the loop, not a whole phase)                                                                                              | `reviewer`    |
| Fix-up (dispatched by the review loop, not by phase routing)                                                                                                                        | `fixer`       |

Phase combines shapes → agent type stays `implementer`, prompt lists every relevant SKILL.md. Agent type changes only when a stack-specialist's risk is the primary one.

**Avoid bouncing the same phase between multiple agents.** Wanting to "hand off" mid-phase → the plan should have split into sub-phases instead.

### 1d. Thorough review

Three layers, all required, in order. The orchestrator never edits — every issue surfaces as a fix-up subagent task.

#### Layer 1 — Mechanical checks

1. `git status` + `git diff --stat`: confirm file list matches the agent's report.
2. **Read the full diff** for every changed file using `git diff`. Spot-checking is not enough.
3. **Verify the outer gate** ran + green. Look in the report for explicit confirmation that `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, AND `npm run format` were executed + passed. Vague confirmation → **re-run yourself**.
4. **Scope creep**: file touched outside expected surface area? Unrelated formatting churn? Surface it.
5. **No-secrets scan**: `git diff` for `password|secret|token|api_key|AKIA|BEGIN [A-Z]+ KEY`.
6. **No AI co-author trailer**: `git log -<n>..HEAD --format=%B | grep -i 'Co-Authored-By'` — any AI trailer is a BLOCKER.

#### Layer 2 — Plan compliance walkthrough

Open phase body alongside diff and walk:

1. **Every numbered "Changes" item implemented.**
2. **Every "Tests" entry materialized**, with assertions actually exercising the called-out behavior.
3. **Acceptance line satisfiable** by the diff.
4. **Repo conventions** from DESIGN.md.
5. **Reusable-skill compliance.**

6. **Feature-flag wiring** if the plan's **Guiding Decisions** declared a flag — flag-OFF byte-for-byte pre-feature behavior, ≥1 test asserts.
7. **Cross-phase consistency** with prior tracking summaries.

#### Layer 3 — Independent reviewer subagent

After Layers 1–2 pass, spawn a **separate** subagent (different session, no implementation context) using the project's `reviewer` agent type ([ai-tools/agents/reviewer.md](ai-tools/agents/reviewer.md)). Read-only by design.

Reviewer prompt template — see the reviewer agent's body for the standard form. Triage findings:

- **BLOCKER**: must fix before the **Branch + push** step below.
- **SHOULD-FIX**: fix in-phase if cheap; else follow-up issue + tracking note.
- **NIT**: ignore unless trivially cheap.

Reviewer finds nothing on a >300-LoC multi-file phase → suspicious. Read once more.

#### Fix loop

1. Spawn a **new** subagent — project's `fixer` agent type ([ai-tools/agents/fixer.md](ai-tools/agents/fixer.md)). Fix prompt quotes the finding verbatim.
2. The `fixer`'s system prompt mandates re-running the inner loop + outer gate.
3. After fixer returns, redo Layer 1 in full + the affected portion of Layer 2.
4. Loop until Layers 1, 2, 3 are clean.

### 1e. Branch + push

Branch naming: `plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}`.

**First executed phase** (branches from `main`):

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}
# subagent's commits land on this branch
git push -u origin plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}
```

**Subsequent phases** (stacked on the previous phase's branch):

```bash
git checkout plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{prev.id}
git checkout -b plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}
git push -u origin plan/{plan-id-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}
```

PR opening lives in the [Open PR via context file](#1f-open-pr-via-context-file) step below (single flow — context file + `open-pr.sh`). Subagents never open PRs themselves; the orchestrator does, after review passes.

### 1f. Open PR via context file

This is the **only** PR-creation path. PRs always go through a `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/{feature-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}.md` file + the bundled [open-pr.sh](../foundation-skills/open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh) script — even when inline comments are not requested. The file is the durable record; the script is the publisher.

Two project-level signals decide the actual behavior:

| `PR creation policy: **agents create PRs** — every phase opens a PR via the bundled prs-context file + [open-pr.sh](../open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh).` policy | `run_options.generate_inline_comments` | What this **Open PR via context file** step does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Surface this in the [Send brief update](#1h-send-brief-update-to-user) step. |

#### Steps

1. **Skip if neither column applies** (policy = branches only AND `generate_inline_comments = false`). Jump to the [Update tracking file](#1g-update-tracking-file) step.

2. **Honor existing PR / MR templates.** Read `project.pr_template_paths` from `.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml`. For each entry:
   - **One template** → load it; the prs-context `# Description` body must follow that template's section structure verbatim. Fill each section with phase-specific content drawn from the plan's **Goals + Non-goals**, **Guiding Decisions**, and the phase body. Preserve any `<!-- HTML comments -->` placeholders; do not strip the template's checklists. Sections you can't fill from phase data → leave the template's placeholder/prompt untouched (don't fabricate).
   - **Multiple templates** (`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory) → ask once via `AskUserQuestion`: list each template + its filename, ask which to use for this run. Cache the choice in tracking under `run_options.pr_template_used` so subsequent phases of the same plan use the same one without re-asking.
   - **Empty array** → free-form description. Default sections: `## Summary` (1–3 sentences), `## Plan reference` (link / phase id), `## Test plan` (commands the reviewer can run).

   When the project's PR template includes a checkbox checklist (e.g. `- [ ] Tests added`, `- [ ] Docs updated`), tick the boxes the phase's diff actually satisfies and leave unsatisfied ones unticked — never auto-tick everything.

   GitHub also honors `?template=<name>` in the PR-create URL when the project has a multi-template directory. `gh pr create --body-file` writes the body directly so the URL trick isn't needed; the body must match the chosen template's structure regardless.

3. **Pick comment targets** (only when `generate_inline_comments = true`). Read the phase diff via `git diff main...HEAD` (or the previous phase branch for stacked phases). Select 3–10 spots that benefit from a one-paragraph context note — typically:
   - A subtle invariant the diff relies on (cite the plan's **Goals + Non-goals** / **Guiding Decisions** entries — by name, never use `§` shorthand).
   - A workaround for a known framework / library limitation.
   - A naming choice driven by an upstream contract.
   - The off-flag short-circuit when a feature flag is in **Guiding Decisions**.
   - Why a seemingly-cleaner refactor wasn't made (out of scope per **Goals + Non-goals**).
   - Cross-phase coupling (this hook is consumed by phase N+k).

   Skip lint/format churn, boilerplate matching nearby files, standard patterns from DESIGN.md, and self-explanatory test names. **A clean phase produces few comments — that's fine. Don't pad.**

   When `generate_inline_comments = false`: skip this step. The file's `# Comments` block stays empty.

4. **Write `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/{feature-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}.md`** following [resources/prs-context-template.md](../prs-context-template.md). Frontmatter: `plan_id`, `feature_name`, `phase_id`, `phase_title`, `branch`, `base`, `created_at`, `status: pending`, empty `pr_url`. Body sections: `# Title` (single-line PR title), `# Description` (Markdown body — uses the project's PR template structure from step 2 when one exists), `# Comments` (YAML list of `{file, start_line, end_line?, side, body}` — empty list when comments are off).

5. **Confirm `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/` is in `.gitignore`.** [vinta-install-ai-tools-setup](../../../vinta-install-ai-tools-setup/SKILL.md) runs the multi-vendor setup script which appends `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/` on its first invocation. If an older bootstrap missed it, append it now.

6. **Run `open-pr.sh`** (only when policy = agents create PRs). Detect a usable CLI (`gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab) plus the script's other deps (`yq`, `jq`):

   ```bash
   bash ai-tools/skills/open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh .vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/{feature-kebab}/phase-{phase.id}.md
   ```

   Script opens the PR (or detects an existing one), posts each inline comment, rewrites the file's frontmatter to `status: published` + populated `pr_url`, appends a publish log. Exit codes:
   - `0` — PR up, all comments (if any) posted. Capture `pr_url` for the [Send brief update](#1h-send-brief-update-to-user) step.
   - `1` — PR up, ≥1 comment failed. Surface the failed `(file:line)` list to the user; continue to the [Update tracking file](#1g-update-tracking-file) step.
   - `2` — Hard failure (deps missing, branch not pushed, CLI unauthed, file invalid). Surface the script's stderr; treat the phase as having no PR. The file stays `status: pending` so the user can re-run after fixing the gap.

   When policy = "branches only": **don't run the script.** File stays `status: pending`.

7. **Skill wrapper** — [open-pr-from-context](../foundation-skills/open-pr-from-context/SKILL.md) is available for ad-hoc invocation (after the run, on a different machine, etc.). The orchestrator can call the script directly here; the skill is for humans.

### 1g. Update tracking file

Tracking lives at `ai-plans/TRACKING_{plan-id}.md`. Commit on the **current** phase's branch — deletion in Step 3.

Schema: feature-name, plan path, started/last-updated dates, optional feature-flag info, completed-phases (with status, model, branch, base, e2e+screenshots if any, 5–15 line summary), current phase, remaining phases, deferred phases.

The orchestrator writes this from the git diff + the agent's summary — not from the agent's narration.

### 1h. Send brief update to user

One short paragraph: phase N done, branch pushed, PR opened, what got built, and — when the [Open PR via context file](#1f-open-pr-via-context-file) step ran — the PR-context file path with its `status` (`published` + URL when `open-pr.sh` opened the PR; `pending` when the script wasn't run because PR policy = branches only or deps were missing). When `status: pending`, mention how to publish later (`bash ai-tools/skills/open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh <path>`). Moving to phase N+1. No long retrospective — tracking file is the durable record.

### 1i. Per-phase pause gate (opt-in)

`run_options.pause_between_phases = false` (default) → **immediately spawn the next phase**. Do not wait.

`run_options.pause_between_phases = true` → ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

- `Continue — start phase N+1`
- `Pause — stop here, I'll resume later by re-invoking the skill` (orchestrator exits cleanly; tracking file already records progress so the next invocation resumes mid-plan per the "Re-running mid-plan" section).
- `Stop — abort the plan run` (orchestrator stops; user decides next steps manually).

Wait for the answer. Don't spawn anything in the meantime. The pause is the user's review window — they may inspect the diff, the branch, the PR-context file, or the tracking file before agreeing to continue.

## Cross-repo phases

Phase in another repo:

1. **Do not implement.**
2. Mark in tracking under "Deferred Phases".
3. Continue to the next in-repo phase. Don't block on cross-repo work.

## Flag-removal phase (always out of scope)

Plan declared a flag → last phase is `Phase N — Remove the {flag-key} feature flag`. This skill **never** executes that phase. Flag removal is gated on real-world soak signal + is the exclusive responsibility of a dedicated flag-removal skill (separate skill).

What this skill does instead:

1. Identify the phase during Step 0; always exclude.
2. Mark in tracking as deferred.
3. End the run with a `/schedule` offer pointing at the dedicated flag-removal skill.
4. Refuse + redirect if user asks this skill to remove the flag.

## Re-running mid-plan

User invokes the skill against a partially-done plan:

1. Read `ai-plans/TRACKING_{plan-id}.md` if present.
2. `git branch -a | grep plan/{plan-id-kebab}` to detect already-pushed phase branches.
3. Cross-reference with the plan's phase list.
4. Confirm resumption point with the user.

## Step 2 — Final report

After all executable phases complete:

1. **Delete `TRACKING_{plan-id}.md`** on the last phase's branch. Commit. The plan file stays.
2. Send the user a final summary: branches pushed (with bases, in stack order); for UI-flow phases — list of `pr-screenshots/` files (if applicable); deferred phases (cross-repo + flag-removal); next steps for the human.
3. PR URLs for each phase, in stack order.
4. Flag-removal phase deferred → end with `/schedule` offer for the dedicated flag-removal skill.

## Important rules

- **Read DESIGN.md** in every phase prompt.
- **Stage explicitly.** No `git add -A`.
- **Subagents work in fresh sessions.** Each phase = a new subagent. Tracking + plan files = the context handoff.
- **Orchestrator owns git topology.** Subagents commit but never branch, push, or open PRs themselves.
- **No AI co-author trailers in commits.** The project forbids them; treat any AI trailer as a BLOCKER.
- **Trust the plan's per-phase model suggestion.**
- **Don't re-implement what a project skill encodes.**

- **Two-tier verification, in order, every phase.** Inner scoped, outer full repo.
- **Three-layer review, every phase, no exceptions.**
- **Orchestrator never edits code.**
- **Feature flags = gates, not toggles for tests.**
- **Never remove a feature flag from this skill.**
- **Stop on Tier-4 failure.**
- **Honor opt-in flags.** `run_options.pause_between_phases` controls the [Per-phase pause gate](#1i-per-phase-pause-gate-opt-in); `run_options.generate_inline_comments` controls whether the [Open PR via context file](#1f-open-pr-via-context-file) step drafts inline comments (always writes the file when that step runs at all — empty comments when off).
- **PR-context file + `open-pr.sh` is the only PR-creation path.** No raw `gh pr create` / `glab mr create` calls outside the bundled script. The file is durable; the script is the publisher.
- **[Open PR via context file](#1f-open-pr-via-context-file) gating** = combination of project PR policy (PR creation policy: **agents create PRs** — every phase opens a PR via the bundled prs-context file + [open-pr.sh](../open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh).) and `generate_inline_comments`. See the matrix in that step. Skip it entirely only when policy = branches only AND comments = off.
- **Never use `§N` shorthand to point at sections** — neither in this skill body nor in any rendered file (tracking, prs-context, branch description). Always use the section's full name with a markdown link when possible. `§N` references are hard to read for humans and brittle when section numbering shifts.

## Quick checklist (orchestrator, per phase)

- [ ] Plan parsed; structured fields cached.
- [ ] Cross-repo + flag-removal phases identified + deferred.
- [ ] Current phase: prompt composed with **Goals + Non-goals** + **Guiding Decisions** + relevant **Data Model Changes** subsection + tracking summaries + this phase's body.
- [ ] Model picked from `**Suggested AI model**:` line (cheapest available); plan tier recorded.
- [ ] Subagent spawned, report received.
- [ ] Inner loop green: scoped lint + new tests individually + scoped suite.
- [ ] **Outer gate green:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, AND `npm run format` all passed.
- [ ] Layer 1 review: full diff read; no scope creep; no secrets; outer gate confirmed; no AI co-author trailer.
- [ ] Layer 2 review: every "Changes" ticked; every "Tests" materialized; acceptance line satisfiable; conventions, reusable skills, e2e + screenshot compliance (if applicable), flag wiring all checked.
- [ ] Layer 3 review: adversarial review run; BLOCKERs fixed; SHOULD-FIX either fixed or noted.
- [ ] After any fix-up: Layers 1 + 2 + outer gate re-run.
- [ ] Stacked branch created; pushed.
- [ ] **Open PR via context file** decision applied per matrix (PR policy + `generate_inline_comments`):
  - [ ] PR-context file written when at least one of policy=create / comments=true holds.
  - [ ] `open-pr.sh` run when policy=create AND deps available; PR URL captured.
  - [ ] Per-comment failures (exit 1) surfaced with `(file:line)` list.
  - [ ] Hard failure (exit 2) surfaced; file left `status: pending`.
- [ ] `TRACKING_{plan-id}.md` updated.
- [ ] One-paragraph user update sent (PR URL or pending-file path included).
- [ ] If `run_options.pause_between_phases = true`: prompted user (`Continue` / `Pause` / `Stop`); honored answer.
- [ ] If `run_options.pause_between_phases = false`: next phase started immediately.
- [ ] On final phase: tracking file deleted; final summary lists branches with PR URLs; any `status: pending` PR-context files listed with publish command; `/schedule` offer for flag-removal if applicable.
